# About Me!

Hello, and welcome to my personal portfolio.  My name is **Manasa Akella**, and I am a **third year Mechanical Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology** studying to receive my **Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering** and a **minor in Robotics and Automation**.

## Interests

I am particularly interested in mechatronics, the application of robotics in manufacturing, product design, and research, design and testing.  After obtaining my Bachelor's degree,  I hope to return to a university to work towards earning a Master's degree in engineering.

## Contact

This portfolio is intended to share about my experience as a Mechanical engineer. If you have any questions, comments, or would like to reach out for any 
other reason you can email me at manasa.6315@gmail.com or reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/manasa-akella6315)

## Projects

### FIRST Robotics Competition CAD

The goal of the FIRST Robotics Competition team was to build a fully functional, 120-pound robot with a $5,000 budget in only six weeks. In this folder you 
can find the design and CAD files that I was in charge of creating during the 2018 season.

### Hackathons

I have participated in a few Hackathons and you can find the notable ones and the code associated with them in this folder

### Hyperloop Team

The HyperJackets is Georgia Tech's entrant in the Hyperloop competitions. Our primary purpose is to research, design, build, and test Hyperloop pod 
concepts to improve high-speed ground transportation methods for the benefit of all of humanity. Our secondary purpose is to represent Georgia Tech in 
Hyperloop design competitions, including but not limited to those directed by SpaceX.

### Research

As an intern for the Air Force Research Laboratory I aided to develop reinforcement learning models for a robotic manufacturing process to optimize the 
propeller blade inspection process along with an electromagnetic robot arm attachment to run a high-fidelity benchtop model for risk-free testing. Allowed 
Warner Robins Air Force base to increase blade throughput by 300 percent. The findings of this project are in the process of publication and are currently 
up for an award.
