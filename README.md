# About Me!

    Hello, and welcome to my personal portfolio.  My name is Manasa Akella, and I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student at Georgia Institute of
    Technology studying to receive my Bachelors of Science in Mechanicall Engineering and a minor in Robotics and Automation. I am particularly interested 
    in mechatronics, the application of robotics in manufacturing, product design, and research, design and testing.  After obtaining my Bachelor's degree, 
    I hope to return to a university to work towards earning a Master's degree in engineering.  
    
    This portfolio is intended to share about my experience as a Mechanical engineer.  If you have any questions, comments, or would like to reach out for 
    any other reason you can email me at manasa.6315@gmail.com or reach me on LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/manasa-akella6315
